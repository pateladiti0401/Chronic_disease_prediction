# Chronic Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is designed to detect chronic diseases—specifically heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease—at an early stage using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes patient demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors, the system is capable of providing highly accurate predictions, enabling timely interventions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Disease Detection:** Predicts the likelihood of heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease using six advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Comprehensive Data Integration:** Utilizes a rich dataset comprising patient demographics, medical history, and lifestyle information to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Features a user-friendly Power BI dashboard for visualizing prediction results and key insights.
- **Python Backend:** The backend is developed in Python, ensuring robust data processing and model execution.
- **ReactJS Frontend:** The user interface is built with ReactJS, providing a seamless and interactive experience for users.
- **Healthcare Impact:** Aims to improve preventive healthcare, enhance patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs by offering personalized insights and early detection.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implemented six advanced algorithms to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI is used for creating an interactive dashboard that visualizes prediction results and trends.
- **Backend:** Python is used for data processing, model training, and API development.
- **Frontend:** Developed a responsive website using ReactJS for user interaction and data presentation.

## Objectives

- Enhance preventive healthcare through early detection of chronic diseases.
- Improve patient outcomes by providing accurate and timely predictions.
- Reduce healthcare costs by enabling proactive and personalized healthcare management.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pateladiti0401/Chronic_disease_prediction.git
   ```

2. **Set up the Python backend:**

   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run the backend server: `python app.py`

3. **run predict scripts to generate .pkl files:**

   - `python predict_diabetes.py`
   - `python predict_heart.py`
   - `python predict_kidney.py`

4. **Set up the ReactJS frontend:**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the frontend server: `npm start`

5. **Access the Power BI dashboard:**

   - Open the provided Power BI file to explore the dashboard and visualize the predictions.
